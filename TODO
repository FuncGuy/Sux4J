- Document each constructor w.r.t. preserving ChunkedHashStore seed and whether it needs a checked one
- The hollow trie distributor could accept a triple for the key and use it to index the left/right function
- Decide where to count transformation-strategy bits
- 64-bit clean?
- Improve ZFast construction memory and time
- Add logging line in main methods to start counters correctly
- Temp directory of ChunkedHashStore (and classes that use it) should be settable.
- Move values lists to disk when possible.
- Jenkins hash should mix better last values. Or XOR with c.
