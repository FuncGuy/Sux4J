Main classes manipulating bits.

<h2>Implementations of bit vectors</h2>

<p>The first building block of Sux4J is the {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.BitVector} interface and the {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.LongArrayBitVector} implementation.
The idea is to offer an efficent but easy-to-use bit-vector class by allowing access under many different <em>views</em>. For instance,
a bit vector can be seen as a {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.LongBigList} of integers of fixed width. Or as a sorted set of
integers, where the positions of the bits set to one represent elements.

<strong>Warning</strong>: implementing all features of {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.LongArrayBitVector} has not been easy. There may be bugs.

<h2>Rank and select</h2>

<p>The second building block is a numbr of implementations of <em>rank/select queries</em> for bits vectors represented by arrays of longs. <em>Ranking</em> is 
counting the number of ones in an initial segment of a bit vector. <em>Selection</em> is finding the position of the
<var>r</var>-th one. Both operation can be performed in constant time on an array of <var>n</var> bits
using <i>o</i>(<var>n</var>) additional bits, but in practise linear data structures with small constants and theoretically non-constant
time work much better. Sux4J proposes a number of new, very efficient implementation of rank and select oriented to 64-bit processors
(in other words: they will be fairly slow on 32-bit processors).

<p>For dense arrays, {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.Rank9} is the only rank implementation. Selection can be performed
using {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.SimpleSelect} for reasonably uniform bit arrays, or using {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.Select9}, which occupies more space
but guarantees practical constant-time evaluation.

<p>For sparse arrays (e.g., representation of pointers in a bitstream) 
we provide {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.SparseRank} and {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.SparseSelect}. Their main
feature is that <em>they do not require the original bit array</em>.

<p>All structures can be serialised. Since in some cases the original bit vector is stored inside the structure, to
avoid saving and loading twice the same vector we suggest to pack all structures into a {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.RankSelect} instance.
