- Document each constructor w.r.t. preserving ChunkedHashStore seed and whether it needs a checked one
- The hollow trie distributor could accept a triple for the key and use it to index the left/right function
- Decide where to count transformation-strategy bits
- Improve ZFast construction memory and time
- Add logging line in main methods to start counters correctly
- Comment all classes!
- Support enclose() in JacobsonBalancedParentheses
- Support UTF-32 in all main() methods.
- Find a way to make the hash computed for functions percolate to a signature, so we don't compute it twice
- Reference correctly the XOR trick
