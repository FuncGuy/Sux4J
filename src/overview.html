    <title>Sux4J: Succinct data structures for Java</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <P>Sux4J is an effort to bring succinct data structures to Java. Presently it provides a very flexible bit vector
    data structure, rank/select implementations, and some stuff related to minimal perfect hashing.

    <P>The rank/select implementations are 64-bit oriented (i.e., they are fast on 64-bit processors). They are
    based on <em>broadword programming</em> and described in 
    Sebastiano Vigna, &ldquo;Broadword Implementation of Rank/Select Queries&rdquo;.

    <P>Sux4J is distributed under the <A
    HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html"><ACRONYM TITLE="GNU's not
    Unix">GNU</ACRONYM> Lesser General Public License</A>.
	
    <h2>Package Dependencies</h2>

    <P>Sux4J uses two packages providing high-performance containers and
    algorithms, that is, <A HREF="http://fastutil.dsi.unimi.it/">fastutil</A> 5 or greater, and
    the <A HREF="http://www-itg.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/">COLT distribution</A>.
    <A HREF="http://mg4j.dsi.unimi.it/">MG4J</A> provides some useful I/O classes.
    Command-line parsing and support requires <a href="http://www.martiansoftware.com/jsap/">JSAP</a>. 
    
    All logging is performed using <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">log4j</a>.
