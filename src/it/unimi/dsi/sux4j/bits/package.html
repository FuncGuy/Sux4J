Main classes manipulating bits.

<h2>Rank and select</h2>

<p>This package provides a number of implementations of <em>rank/select queries</em> for bits vectors. <em>Ranking</em> is 
counting the number of ones in an initial segment of a bit vector. <em>Selection</em> is finding the position of the
<var>r</var>-th one. Both operation can be performed in constant time on an array of <var>n</var> bits
using <i>o</i>(<var>n</var>) additional bits, but in practise linear data structures with small constants and theoretically non-constant
time work much better. Sux4J proposes a number of new, very efficient implementation of rank and select oriented to 64-bit processors
(in other words: they will be fairly slow on 32-bit processors).

<p>For dense arrays, {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.Rank9} is the only rank implementation. Selection can be performed
using {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.SimpleSelect} for reasonably uniform bit arrays, 
or using {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.Select9}, which occupies more space
but guarantees practical constant-time evaluation.

<p>For sparse arrays (e.g., representation of pointers in a bitstream) 
we provide {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.SparseRank} and {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.SparseSelect}. Their main
feature is that <em>they do not require the original bit array</em>, as they use an {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.util.EliasFanoMonotoneLongBigList}
to implement an succint dictionary containing the positions of all ones.

<p>All structures can be serialised. Since in some cases the original bit vector is stored inside the structure, to
avoid saving and loading twice the same vector we suggest to pack all structures into a {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.RankSelect} instance.
