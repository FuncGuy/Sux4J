    <title>Sux4J: Succinct data structures for Java</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <P>Sux4J is an effort to bring succinct data structures to Java. Presently it provides a very flexible bit vector
    data structure, some implementations of <code>rank9</code>-based {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.RankAndSelect}
    structures, and some stuff related to minimal perfect hashing.
    
    <P>Sux4J is distributed under the <A

    Unix">GNU</ACRONYM> Lesser General Public License</A>.
	
    <h2>Why Java?</h2>

    <P>Writing in Java code that (essentially) has to roll bits over and over
    may seem a Bad Thing&trade;. However, one should take into consideration
    the following points:

    <UL>
      <LI>Improvements in JVMs makes low-level code written in Java faster and
      faster; often, the performance penalty w.r.t. an equivalent C/C++
      application is relatively small.
      </LI>

      <LI>Succinct structures can be mixed in several different ways, and an
      object-oriented language makes it very easy to play with different
      implementations of the same interface, or see the same string of bits
      in several different ways (have a look at the views available for
      a {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.bits.BitVector}).</LI>

      <LI>Most of the time, in particular in real-world applications, you will
      need to rewrite all or part of the code. In this case, as a learning tool
      a clean implementation in an object-oriented language is certainly better
      than a C implementation.</LI>
    </UL>

    <h2>Package Dependencies</h2>

    <P>Sux4J uses two packages providing high-performance containers and
    algorithms, that is, <A HREF="http://fastutil.dsi.unimi.it/">fastutil</A> 5 or greater, and
    the <A HREF="http://www-itg.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/">COLT distribution</A>.
    <A HREF="http://mg4j.dsi.unimi.it/">MG4J</A> provides some useful I/O classes.
    Command-line parsing and support requires <a href="http://www.martiansoftware.com/jsap/">JSAP</a>. 
    
    All logging is performed using <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">log4j</a>.
